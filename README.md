# Tennyson McCalla's SNHU Capstone Project

The ePortfolio you see here is the final project for the CS course at SNHU. The intention is to showcase skills either learned or improved upon while taking classes that make up the curriculum. The focus areas are Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms/Data Structures, and Databases.

## Self Assessment

I think for the first half of my time in the SNHU computer science course I didn't even really have a computer. I tried to do essentially everything from my mobile devices (iPhone and eventually iPad). This was more difficult than it had to be due to some incompatibilities between blackboard and web standards.

Eventually I ended up using my busted Linux laptop for the majority of the remaining classes (trackpad buttons did not and still do not work, hardware was old, machine overheated, keys were not backlit, and screen brightness would fluctuate up and down randomly at all times). It was around here that my grades started doing better.

With the help of a friend I managed to temporarily get my hands on relatively recent Windows desktop and that made a world of difference for at least two classes. Given the general exhaustion of working full-time and going to school full-time (and doing well at both of them) that bit of relief was great. But enough personal history.

The capstone project here is a pretty good demonstration of skills. I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by completing the plotly dash app and putting it up here on GitHub. I can imagine lots of different ways the entire project could be enhanced.

I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing code review videos (one of which I've [linked here](https://youtu.be/lrlpe41CcEw)) and the plotly dash app mentioned above.

I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by completing the database section of this capstone project as well as the embedded systems project.

I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the embedded systems project which involved working with the C programming language, microsecond precise timers, as well as hardware interfaces like GPIO, I2C, and UART.

And finally I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the database section of this capstone course where I took advantage of the authentication tools offered by MongoDB.
